# Description
Overview of tasks regarding script development

## To do (main)
- clean up and upload `00_init > clean_masks.ipynb`
- analyses of 3D IF assays
- Refine descriptions
- compile all functions into bin/.py files for better overview
    - also shows potential code redundancy

## In progress
- clean up`02_quality_control > merge_masks.ipynb`
- clean up and upload `02_quality_control > masks_filtering.ipynb`

## Side quests

*User friendliness*
- add example input and output
- add instructions on Colab set-up
- add instructions on cellpose GUI (or just post the link)
- load in files using an input_paths.txt file (columns for name, img_path, mask_path)

*Flow improvement*
- combine find_overlapping_masks_in_Z and merge_masks_in_Z into one notebook

*Extended analyses*
- analyse connected components (info stored in .json merge.ipynb)

*Visualisations*
- Violin+stripplots with a y-lim of [0,1] for easy comparison between merge iterations
