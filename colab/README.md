# Description
Interactive Python Notebooks for quantitative confocal microscopy analyses. Detailed descriptions can be found in the READMEs in the subdirectories.

*Note: Developed in Google Colab with Colab-specific functionalities:
    - Ability to connect to GPU.
    - Forms functionality for easy user input.

## Overview
### [Initialise](./00_init)
Notebooks for optional pre-processing.
- **get_subsection.ipynb**: get x-y subsection(s) of stacks.

### [Segmentation](./01_segmentation)
Notebooks for segmentation of nuclei and foci in (confocal) microscopy data.
- **01_run_2Dcellpose_pretrained_models.ipynb**: segment a 2D TIFF file with all available Cellpose models (v2.2.2)
- **02_HITL_model_finetuning.ipynb**: finetune a pre-trained Cellpose model using 2D TIFFs and manually-refined annotations.
- **03_run_cellpose_on_stack**: segment a multiplane TIFF file using a pre-trained or custom Cellpose model.
- **foci_segmentation**: segment foci in a multiplane TIFF file using heuristic intensity-based methods (otsu, watershed)

### [Quality control](./02_quality_control/)
Notebooks for filtering/refining masks.
- **merging_masks_in_Z.ipynb**:  merging masks in Z-direction (interpolation)
- **inspect_3Dmask_stats.ipynb**: retrieving mask statistics (e.g., diameter, volume) for QC

### [Quantification](./03_quantification/)
Notebooks for quantitative analyses.
- **find_overlapping_masks_in_Z.ipynb**: Finding overlapping masks of two 2D label matrices.
- **2Dlabel_overlap_comparison.ipynb**: comparison between overlap of two 2D label matrices. (precision, recall, F1-score, Jaccard Indices)
- **SpotPerNucleus.ipynb**: Comparing 3D nuclear segmentations with 3D spots.
